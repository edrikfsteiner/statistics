A simple Python CRUD project where I tested my data structure knowledge by creating a vector storage. You can insert numbers in a vector object, name and store it in a storage object. By accessing these vectors, you can do CRUD operations like insert new elements, delete them, sort them and do mathematical functions, like finding the mode, variance, deviation, etc.

Further development will introduce the capacity of comparing vectors and do the similar operations latter mentioned
